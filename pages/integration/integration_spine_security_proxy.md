## Spine Security Proxy (SSP) ##

The SSP is a forward HTTP proxy which will be used as a front end to control and protect access to the Prescription Exemption Checking Service in Phase 1.  It provides a single security point for both authentication and authorisation for dispensing systems. Additional responsibilities include auditing of all requests, throttling of requests and transaction logging for performance purposes.

### Proxied Prescription Exemption Checks###

For Phase 1 implementations FHIR endpoint location will be performed internally by the consumer system utilising the patientâ€™s GP organisational identifier (for example, ODSCode as returned from a separate PDS lookup process) with the provider's server endpoint being resolved via Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries to the [Spine Director Service (SDS)](integration_spine_directory_service.html).

{% include important.html content="All HTTP communications are expected to be secured using TLS mutual authentication (MA)." %}

{% include important.html content="All N3 connected systems are expected to synchronise their local system clocks to the N3 Network Time Protocol (NTP) reference source." %}

Once the provider server's endpoint is determined using the SDS, an HTTP request to the proxy server will be constructed as follows:

```http
GET https:/[proxy_server]/https://[api_host]/Prescription-Exemptions/1.0.0/search
```

A number of Spine specific HTTP headers also need to be populated with the intended Spine interactionID and system ASIDs.

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Dispensing System's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | NHSBSA's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | Prescription Exemption Checking Service InteractionID |

Please refer to the [Spine Security Proxy Implementation Guide](integration_spine_security_proxy_implementation_guide.html) for full technical details.

Interaction ID and SDS details are available at [Spine Security Proxy Implementation Guide](integration_spine_security_proxy_implementation_guide.html)

Furthermore, the consumer's client certificate is validated to ensure it includes valid certificate `CN` and `DN` details and that the certificate has not been added to the certificate revocation list (CRL).
